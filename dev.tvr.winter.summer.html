<p>  From my observation, In my opinion, Winter the best season.</p>
<p>Winter comes, snow follows, everything became white, it's really beautiful, although it's cold outside, but it's not a big deal. Playing hockey and snowball is the best part of winter, and it plays an important role in my life.</p>

<p> Summer is the best season. I hate cold days, that really drives me mad. In summer,I can enjoy playing all kinds of ball games under the warm sunlight and practise my body. Relaxing near the beach is really enjoying. Also, Ice-Cream is the best, After playing sports, eating a ice-cream is the best thing in the world ever.</p>
